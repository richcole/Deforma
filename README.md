Game
====

Experiments with OpenGL in Java. Built using Maven. 

You can download a built version of the game from 

  http://public.richcole.org.s3.amazonaws.com/Game/Game-0.0.1-release.zip

So far not too much to see, a creature walking off into the
distance. A basic floor of tiles, a skybox. The code has the ability
to import models from Neverwinter nights if you have a copy of the
game.

Basic movement with the mouse and keyboard. Press <return> to activate
the mouse. 'a', 's', 'w', 'd' are used to move around. 'q' and 'e'
move up and down. 'space' shoots a cube.

Quick build is via:

  ./run.sh

More extensive instructions including setting up with eclipse are in
the wiki.
