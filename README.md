Game
====

Experiments with OpenGL in Java. Built using Maven. 

You can download a built version of the game from 

  http://public.richcole.org.s3.amazonaws.com/Game/Game-0.0.1-release.zip

So far not too much to see, a creature walking off into the
distance. A basic floor of tiles, a skybox. The code has the ability
to import models from Neverwinter nights if you have a copy of the
game.

Right click and drag to pan the camera. Move using 'a', 's', 'w', 'd'
are used to move around. 'q' and 'e' move up and down. Left click to
select a tile or creature on a tile. Use the wheel to modify terrain.

Quick build is via:

  ./run.sh

More extensive instructions including setting up with eclipse are in
the wiki.
